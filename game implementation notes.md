To decide details of implementation game itself.

1. last level and everything might be stored across termination
https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#pref

2. A generic level class.
What arguments would this require? Starting node configuration?

3. Node class(es) as described in UI file

4. level selection screens

5. Screens for you won/ lost (if it is even possible to lose)

6. tutorial

7. I think the game itself would be on a Canvas, with the same activity for each level but only the java class behaving differently
